Welcome to 2024, we have some exciting stuff going on here and we want to use the 2024 edition to celebrate the community. 

For those new around here this repository was started in 2022 with my learning journey into DevOps, getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". In 2023 we invited some friends to contribute on their subject to enable the community more learning content and resources. 

In 2024 we are going big and getting more of the community involved and exploring a new format. For each day we will have a video session from a member of the community sharing their story, demos and or projects. 

A big thing about the repository has been the accessibility in regards that all tools and hands-on scenarios we have walked through are freely available to the community. This will continue to be the ethos of this community and event.
